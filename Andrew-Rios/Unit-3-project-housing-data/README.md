## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starter Code | *Intermediate* - Project Prompts (Linreg + KNN) | [Here](./linreg-and-knn/Unit-3-project-linreg-and-knn.ipynb) |
| Dataset | Ames Housing Dataset | [Here](./data/iowa_houses.csv) |

## Project Objective

In this project, you'll build a linear regression model and an optional KNN model via guided prompts. You will be exposed to model validation using the train/test split and K-Fold methods in order to fit three different models on sample Ames housing data.

You will be:
  - Creating a train/test split of the data.
  - Training each of your models on the training data.
  - Evaluating each of the models on the test data.
  - Ranking the models by how well they score on the testing data set.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the **required** questions. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from the starter code provided.
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Bonus**: After completing the required portions, try your hand at the **bonus** section for some additional challenges!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

## Submission

Please submit your project by adding your notebook(s) to your named folder in the course's project repository (separately from the classroom repo that you've been changing), pushing your solutions, and submitting a pull request back to the relevant repo.

Make sure to provide interpretation for all outputs.
